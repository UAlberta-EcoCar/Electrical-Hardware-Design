# Electrical-2022-Design-Hardware_Xbee-Internal-Board
Contains the hardware for the Xbee internal board that is mounted inside the car (antenna will stick out obviously).

This board reads the UART/RS232 serial data from the fuel cell controller into an xbee rf microcontroller.  The microcontroller transmits said data to another Xbee microcontroller that is external to the car (see Xbee-External).
