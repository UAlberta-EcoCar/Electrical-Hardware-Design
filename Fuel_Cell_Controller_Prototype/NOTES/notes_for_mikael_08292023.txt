NOTES FOR MIKAELS WORK
- We want the reset pin for STH31D connected to MCU (this will be pulldown logic)
- Maybe use the ALERT pin idk (put X on the pin if not used)
- We have an available I2C bus, connect them to this
- Decoupling capacitor should be 100n
- Do you know how we are supposed to solder this thing? Is it in stock?
- Don't choose just any pins, PF1 is taken! (We actually need to check and choose 5V tolerant pins for both)
